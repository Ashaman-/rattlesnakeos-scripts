## Overview
This an example of a custom shell script that in this case sets a custom boot animation. You can test this out by passing an additional option to rattlesnakeos-stack: --repo-patches https://github.com/RattlesnakeOS/example_patch_shellscript.git

Of course, you can also create your own patch repo with a different boot animation or any additional patches you want.
